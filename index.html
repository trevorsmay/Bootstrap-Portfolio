                    My name is Trevor and here's a little bit more about who I am: I was born here in the Mile High City. I
                    have a dog named Byron. Ideally I would love to be able to become successful at front-end web
                    development
                    because I am colorblind and that would provide a creative outlet. Or maybe it will prove to be
                    DISASTROUS!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a little brother named Nathan. He went to school to be an archaeologist. He loves history. I too
                    enjoy history and even pursued it as a major in college along with Political Science.

                    The coolest place I've ever been is Norway. It was so beautiful. The people there have such a respect
                    for
                    nature. Some people even go as far as to grow a native grass on their roof.
